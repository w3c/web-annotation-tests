Web Annotation Tests
====================

Testing for the Web Annotation family of specifications is being done using the W3C's Web Platform Tests infrastructure.
This repository contains the sources of tests designed to exercise the specifications.  The specifications themselves,
produced by the [Web Annotation Working Group](http://www.w3.org/annotation/) of the W3C,
are available on [the groupâ€™s main repository page](http://w3c.github.io/web-annotation/).
For information on how these tests are run and written, see:

* [Annotation Model](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/tree/master/annotation-model/README.md)
* [Annotation Protocol](https://github.com/Spec-Ops/web-platform-tests/tree/annotation-protocol/annotation-protocol/README.md)

(Note: The destination URIs for these are expected to migrate to the [Web Test Platform](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests)
environment as peer reviews are completed by that community.)

If you are member of the working group, and you wish to contribute to the content of this repository, please contact Ivan Herman (<ivan@w3.org>), giving him your github login.
